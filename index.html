				<h2>Thank you, Mr. Turner</h2>
			
				<p class="indented-paragraph">For years journalism has been referred to as the first rough draft of history. If that is true, it follows that images on television news can be considered the instant, first rough draft of history. This website has been created to celebrate that history. The memorabilia, highlighted on the following pages, has been collected to commemorate various important news events that played out on television screens around the world. Today those stories have migrated to computer screens, smart phones and a plethora of other digital platforms. This site is also offered as a tribute to Ted Turner, the visionary who is responsible for 24-hour television news.</p>

				<h2>How to navigate the website</h2>

				<p>The <span class="red">Collecting the News</span> website is organized into three major sections:</p>

				<div class="navigation-graphic">

				</div>
				
				<div class="navigation-instructions">	
					<p>The first and largest section features memorabilia that was obtained during major news events. After selecting the <a href="memorabilia.html"><span class="yellow">Memorabilia</span></a> tab in the navigation bar, you will be directed to six sub-categories that include <a href="memorabilia-politics.html"><span class="red">Politics</span></a>, <a href="memorabilia-conflict.html"><span class="red">Conflict</span></a>, <a href="memorabilia-natural-disasters.html"><span class="red">Natural Disasters</span></a>, <a href="memorabilia-breaking-news.html"><span class="red">Breaking News</span></a>, <a href="memorabilia-features.html"><span class="red">Features</span></a> and <a href="memorabilia-miscellaneous.html"><span class="red">Miscellaneous</span></a>. Each sub-category contains items specific to that topic. By selecting each tab, you can navigate through the entire collection of news memorabilia.</p>

				<div class="navigation-instructions">
					<p>The next major section celebrates the history of television news. By selecting the <a href="history.html"><span class="yellow">History</span></a> tab, you will be directed to three sub-categories: <a href="attwiw.html"><span class="red">And That’s The Way It Was…</span></a>, <a href="fmots.html"><span class="red">For More On The Story</span></a> and <a href="newsgatheringtools.html"><span class="red">Newsgathering Tools</span></a>. Paraphrasing the nightly signoff of legendary newsman Walter Cronkite, <a href="attwiw.html"><span class="red">And That’s The Way It Was…</span></a> will be dedicated to the early days of television news.</p>
				</div>

				<div id= "history-instructions" class="clear">
					<p>It might contain photos of events, personalities or gear that played a role in the development of the industry. It may also highlight little known or interesting facts about television's past.<br><br>

					Collecting pieces of history sometimes involves an interesting backstory. <a href="fmots.html"><span class="red">For More On The Story…</span></a> chronicles some of the more unique anecdotes behind the acquisition of items contained in the collection. It will also explain how some items were sought after, but eventually lost.<br><br>

					Equipment is the heart and soul of a newsgathering operation. From the beginning, CNN has attempted to keep its cameras, editing and transmission gear state-of-the-art. Very often, the 24-hour news channel has helped push the envelope of television technology by assisting the manufacturers in the development of broadcast equipment. <a href="attwiw.html"><span class="red">Newsgathering Tools</span></a> will feature gear deployed by CNN since its debut in 1980.</p>

				<div class="navigation-instructions">
					<p>When you select the <a href="newsfeed.html"><span class="yellow">Newsfeed</span></a> tab, you will navigate to the third section. <a href="newsfeed.html"><span class="yellow">Newsfeed</span></a> spotlights food. One of the greatest side benefits of chasing news all over the country is the opportunity it gives you to discover unique restaurants and the regional cuisine they offer. This section features some of the hidden (and not so hidden) treasures encountered during road trips around the newsgathering universe.</p>
