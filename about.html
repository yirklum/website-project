		<p class="paragraph">I’ve been a collector my entire life. Some of the things I have collected were worth saving, many, many others were not. As a young boy, I would look forward to trash night when I could ride my bike around the neighborhood and search for what I perceived as hidden treasures among the discarded waste of my neighbors. As my life progressed, I became somewhat more particular on what was worthy to collect and what should continue the journey to the landfill. When I began my career in television news, I was determined to document that experience by acquiring items that represented the major events I would cover. As was the case in my youth, some of the items I gathered were worth collecting, some…not so much. This website was crafted by my daughter, Christina, to allow me to digitally display some of the artifacts that survived in my collection and represent stories I’ve been lucky enough to cover. I hope anyone who visits the site will enjoy it and maybe learn a little along the way.</p>
