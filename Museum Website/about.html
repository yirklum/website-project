			<h2>Thank you, Mr. Turner</h2>
		
			<p>For years journalism has been referred to as the first rough draft of history. If that is true, it follows that images on television news can be considered the instant, first rough draft of history. This website has been created to celebrate that history. The memorabilia, highlighted on the following pages, has been collected to commemorate various important news events that played out on television screens around the world. Today those stories have migrated to computer screens, smart phones and a plethora of other digital platforms. This site is also offered as a tribute to Ted Turner, the visionary who is responsible for 24-hour television news.</p>
