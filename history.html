					<h3><a href="attwiw.html">And That&apos;s The Way It Was</a></h3>
					<p>This section highlights important moments or innovative developments relating to the history of television news. It will spotlight the changing technology of the industry as well as interesting facts about the earlier days of TV news.<br>(The photo on the left was taken the night John Glenn returned to space. I had the pleasure of working with legendary journalist and personal idol Walter Cronkite. The veteran newscaster set the industry standard for news anchors on television. His ethical and insightful delivery of the nightly network news led to his becoming known as “the most trusted man” in America.)</p>

					<h3><a href="fmots.html">For More On The Story</a></h3>
					<p>Sometimes the story behind the acquisition of items in the collection can be as interesting as the objects themselves. This section will feature some of the more unique backstories relating to memorabilia and how they became part of the collection.<br>(The photos on the right were taken on a trip to Cuba while doing a documentary on baseball. At the end of the trip Hank Aaron, the talent for the program, got Fidel Castro to sign a few baseballs. Aaron very generously allowed me to have one of the balls.) </p>

					<h3><a href="newsgatheringtools.html">Newsgathering Tools</a></h3>
					<p>Since CNN went on the air, the network has insisted on using the best and latest equipment to help gather the news. From cameras and recording gear to transmission devices, CNN has acquired and helped develop equipment that pushed television technology forward. This section features some of the newsgathering tools employed by the network since it began operation in the summer of 1980.<br>(The photo to the left was taken in December of 1982, at the recommissioning of the USS New Jersey. The camera was an RCA TK-76C, the first field camera used by CNN. The better looking of the two crew members in the photo is Gary Shore.)</p>
